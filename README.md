A minimalistic daily journaling desktop app. 
With helpful templates to get started
- {use my own obsidian templates with variations}
- Ai integration :
    - what:
        - the ai should be optional and should be off by default. People will be scared if I tell them their notes are not totally private. 
    - how:  
        - comment on people's day and give suggestions for improvements
        - ask them whether they did the thing they were talking about few notes ago.
        - ask them how there relationship with person x is going these days. x is someone they mentioned in their journal
    - The way to set this up: 
        - ask people to get their api key from gemini, chatgpt, etc.
        - have them input that key. then use that key to have ai working
        - have an easy tutorial in app with images on how to do it. infact write a blog about getting openAI keys and link to it???
